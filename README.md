The Tasks Capacitor
===================

A Trello-like prototype written in Python.

Web part is handled by web.py with HTML, database is MongoDB and it uses Twitter's Bootstrap.

This project was just to try building a simple Python web app using MongoDB. The result is not production ready as it is not developped anymore and just a protoype.
